Problem Statement 
The dataset contains the information like personal information of the customer, transaction information, and bank information belonging to a bank.
It is often necessary to predict when the customers are going to withdraw their money from the bank account and stay dormant. 
Being able to predict this, the bank can take necessary action to prevent customers from withdrawing huge sums and stay an active/loyal customer. 
Our task is to be able to predict the customers who are going to churn based on the information given.
